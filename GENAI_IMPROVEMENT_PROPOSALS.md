# GenAI Monitoring Improvement Proposals

## Overview
These are proposed GenAI enhancements to improve the accuracy and relevance of news monitoring results. Please review and approve before implementation.

## 1. üéØ **Article Relevance Scoring & Filtering**

### Proposal
- Use AI to score each article's relevance to the keywords (0-100)
- Filter out articles below a configurable threshold (e.g., 70/100)
- Add relevance score as a column in Google Sheets

### Benefits
- Eliminates noise and irrelevant articles
- Users see only highly relevant content
- Customizable relevance thresholds per campaign

### Implementation
```python
def ai_score_relevance(article_title, article_content, keywords):
    prompt = f"""
    Score the relevance of this article to the keywords on a scale of 0-100:
    
    Keywords: {keywords}
    Title: {article_title}
    Content: {article_content[:500]}...
    
    Consider:
    - Direct keyword matches
    - Semantic similarity
    - Context relevance
    - Topic alignment
    
    Return only a number between 0-100.
    """
    # Use AI model to generate score
    return score
```

## 2. üìù **AI-Generated Article Summaries**

### Proposal
- Generate concise, keyword-focused summaries for each article
- Replace the removed "resume" field with AI-generated insights
- Include key insights relevant to the monitoring campaign

### Benefits
- Quick understanding without reading full articles
- Consistent summary format
- Highlights relevant aspects for the campaign

### Implementation
- Add summary generation to article processing pipeline
- Store AI summaries in new "AI_Summary" column
- Max 150 characters for Google Sheets compatibility

---

## 3. üè∑Ô∏è **Automatic Article Categorization**

### Proposal
- AI categorizes articles into topics (Technology, Business, Politics, etc.)
- Add category column to help organize large volumes of articles
- Enable filtering by category in dashboard

### Benefits
- Better organization of monitored content
- Easy filtering and analysis
- Trend identification by category

---

## 4. üîç **Smart Keyword Expansion**

### Proposal
- AI suggests related keywords based on monitored articles
- Identify trending related terms from article content
- Auto-expand search queries for better coverage

### Benefits
- Discover content you might miss with original keywords
- Adaptive monitoring that learns from results
- Broader but still relevant coverage

---

## 5. üìä **Sentiment Analysis & Trend Detection**

### Proposal
- Analyze sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) for each article
- Detect trending topics within your monitoring results
- Generate weekly AI insights reports

### Benefits
- Understand public sentiment about your topics
- Identify emerging trends early
- Automated reporting with AI insights

---

## 6. üö® **Intelligent Alert System**

### Proposal
- AI determines when articles are "high priority" for immediate attention
- Smart notifications for breaking news or significant developments
- Customizable AI criteria for different types of alerts

### Benefits
- Don't miss critical developments
- Reduced notification fatigue
- AI helps prioritize attention

---

## 7. üîÑ **Continuous Learning & Optimization**

### Proposal
- AI learns from user feedback (article ratings, clicks)
- Continuously improves relevance scoring
- Adapts to user preferences over time

### Benefits
- Monitoring quality improves with usage
- Personalized results for each campaign
- Self-optimizing system

---

## Implementation Priority Suggestions

### Phase 1 (High Impact, Medium Effort)
1. **Article Relevance Scoring** - Immediate noise reduction
2. **AI-Generated Summaries** - Replace removed resume field

### Phase 2 (Medium Impact, Low Effort)  
3. **Automatic Categorization** - Better organization
4. **Sentiment Analysis** - Added insights

### Phase 3 (High Impact, High Effort)
5. **Smart Keyword Expansion** - Improved coverage
6. **Intelligent Alerts** - Proactive monitoring

### Phase 4 (Future Enhancement)
7. **Continuous Learning** - Long-term optimization

---

## Technical Requirements

### AI Model Options
- **OpenAI GPT-4/3.5**: High quality, API-based
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Local deployment, privacy
- **Google Gemini**: Integration with Google Workspace
- **Anthropic Claude**: Strong reasoning capabilities

### Infrastructure Considerations
- API costs for cloud-based AI
- Processing time for large article volumes
- Storage for AI-generated metadata
- Rate limiting and error handling

---

## Cost Estimation

### Monthly AI Processing Costs (estimated)
- **Small campaigns** (100 articles/month): $5-10
- **Medium campaigns** (500 articles/month): $20-40  
- **Large campaigns** (2000 articles/month): $80-150

### Performance Impact
- Additional 2-5 seconds per article for AI processing
- Can be done asynchronously to avoid user delays
- Background processing during campaign execution

---

## User Configuration Options

### Per-Campaign Settings
- Relevance threshold (0-100)
- Enable/disable AI summaries
- Category preferences
- Alert sensitivity levels

### Global AI Settings
- AI model selection
- Processing preferences
- Cost controls and limits
